    <p>Hello! My name is Francisco Guerrero and I am a math teacher. I am headed to be a softwer developer and website builder. My hobbies are playing with the nintenfo switch and reading novels from the past</p>
    <p>I have been married for three years to my wife Cynthia Carocca and we don't have children yet</p>
    <p>My actually job is a math teacher full tome and my bug change is organize my time for stuided. What I like most about MYU-Idaho is that it mixes teaching with a career and growing spiritually. And I am studying WDD. In this course I hope to learn to develop web pages in the best possible way to grow as a professional. I have been a member of the church for 6 months and my favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 25:26. Nice to meet you and I hope it goes well for us</p>
