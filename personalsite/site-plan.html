      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to provide support to all high school students so that they can learn mathematics in an entertaining and interactive way. In other words, we focus on the teaching of mathematics and on generating an autonomous study of the students who enter here. How will this be done? Showing new ways to teach math, making it engaging and student-centered.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Are you bored of not understanding math?
        Do you feel that what it teaches you will not help you at all?
        On this web page we will offer you the option to replicate the teaching methods as many times as you want and also show the usefulness of mathematics.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Who is it addressed to</h3>
      <p>
        The website serves so that people who have a deficit in mathematics have a new tool for autonomous learning of this subject, which is considered one of the most difficult. Since the most remote times, mathematics has been present around us, being one of the topics necessary for the evolution of the human being. This is demonstrated from the creation of numerical sets, which help us to count and understand the geometry that surrounds us, to the new technological advances that are related to new discoveries in science. Although we still need to progress in some discoveries within mathematics, the great advance that humanity has in the use of mathematics is identified.

      <h3>Difficulty in learning mathematics</h3>
      <p>
        On this page you will find that everyone can learn mathematics, that you can really get ahead with this subject, that difficulties are temporary, and that each person has a different learning pace. You should know that you are not the only person who makes it difficult for them to understand mathematics, this is shown in national and international measurements that agree that mathematics is one of the most problematic areas in terms of student performance. (Friz, Henriquez & Sanchez, 2009). It is observed that this subject is a problem at an international level, so do not feel alone, you are not the only one and this brings with it a failure in learning mathematics that is closely linked to linguistic processes, for example, in comprehension. of the statement of a problem. Studies indicate that the probability of correctly answering a math question would not only be conditioned by the students' mathematical abilities, but also by their familiarity with the different question formats, that is, with the language (Ramírez 2002). In the previous quote we managed to glimpse that for the understanding of mathematics not only the skills that are developed in the same subject are involved, but also language skills are related, therefore, you should know that this website will show so many skills math with problem solving, where you can develop language skills. Along with this you will be able to identify how capable and how far you can go with mathematics.

      <h3>Work methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Here you will find various work methodologies, where the content to be worked on will be explained step by step, there will also be an option where you can find the videos in Spanish in case English is not your main language. You will find work guides, where the main thing is not to perform many exercises, on the contrary, the exercises where you will put into practice what is explained in the videos will be limited, these activities will not exceed 5 exercises per exercise guide. The existence of a problem in the teaching-learning of mathematics education is also observed where "an abysmal distance is also recognized between what is taught at school and what society demands for a full and active working life, perhaps this is due to the perception that the mathematics that lives in school has little or nothing to do with the daily life of students” (Cantoral, Montiel & Reyes-Gasperini, 2015, pp 7). It is for this reason that one of the currents of mathematics will be used in the teaching of mathematics, Socioepistemology, where the epistemological origin of the concepts to be worked on is sought.
